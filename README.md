C language

## Directions for use / How to start 

```
On Linux

1. Open a terminal
2. Install gcc ($ sudo apt‐get install gcc)
3. Compile source code (ex: $ gcc ‐o out.exe main.c)
4. Run the complied file (ex: $ ./out.exe)
```

```
On MacOS

1. Open a terminal
2. Compile source code (ex: $ gcc ‐o out.exe main.c)
      If gcc is not installed, it will prompt you to do a gcc installation process.
